Blockchain-Based Banking System in Python

This project is a simple blockchain-based banking system implemented in Python. It demonstrates how blockchain technology can be used to manage accounts, transactions, and mining, ensuring data integrity and transparency through a secure ledger.

The system is designed for educational purposes to help students and learners understand how blockchain concepts can be applied in real-world scenarios like digital banking.

*Features*
Account creation and balance management
Secure transactions between accounts
Mining mechanism to validate and add transactions to the blockchain
Blockchain ledger that maintains an immutable record of all transactions
SHA-256 hashing for data integrity
Simple command-line interface for interaction

*How It Works*

Accounts: Each user has an account with a balance.
Transactions: Users can send money to each other, and each transaction is recorded.
Mining: Pending transactions are grouped into blocks. Miners solve a proof-of-work puzzle to validate and add the block to the chain.
Blockchain Ledger: Every block contains a hash of the previous block, forming a secure chain. This ensures that data cannot be tampered with.
